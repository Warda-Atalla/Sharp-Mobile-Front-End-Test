# Sharp-Mobile-Front-End-Test
create a responsive one page front-end for a local restaurant that sells the best burgers in town.
I send zip file by E-mail 
1- To open the webpage file you need to download the zip folder and open "index.html" file. The easy way right click open with Safari there are CSS file and IMG file.
If you want to take a look for the original design you need to have adobe suite on your device.


*for the worst case scenario*
I have send the index.html styleshhet.css by it self in case we need to.
download index.html file and take all copy and past on your one file.
creat css folder and take a copy from the sylesheet and save it in side the css folder The Img folder should work fine
